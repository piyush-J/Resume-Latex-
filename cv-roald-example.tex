\section*{Key Projects}
\begin{tabularcv}
    \textbf{June 2017}        &   \textbf{Correlation Convolution Neural Network for Reconstruction of Cropped Images}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep,topsep=0pt, label={\Large\textbullet}]
\item A novel step-based correlation multi-modal CNN (CorrMCNN) model was proposed which reconstructs one view of the data given the other.
\item The interaction between the representations is increased at each hidden layer.
\item Through extensive experiments, it was found that the proposed model achieves a better performance than the current state-of-the-art techniques on joint common representation learning and transfer learning. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep, topsep=0pt, label={\Large\textbullet}]
\item A prototype of a low-cost interactive Smartboard was designed which allows us to convert any display unit (e.g., a monitor, a projection screen, etc.) into a Smartboard.
\item With the help of a Smart Pen and the executable file we can setup an interactive classroom. 
\item This idea is being currently extended to finger tracking and low-cost head tracking.
